You've been on top of it since it didn't have a name and you'll start setting up trades on the double.		<br />		For others, this might be a new term altogether, and you might be trying to figure out how to get started and do things right. That's normal, this not exactly a mainstream movement and might not ever be.		<br />		Or, you might just find yourself somewhere in between knowing and not knowing about bottle trading. No problem!		</p>		This section is dedicated to bringing clarity to the system of bottle trading wherever it may be needed. Let's get started with some important points:		<ul>			<li>Bottle trading is comprised of a dedicated and respected community of craft beer traders that connect and deliver rare beers to one another			</li>			<li>These traders base their transactions on a "good faith" system			</li>			<li>This can get pricey! There really aren't many ways to get around heavy and large package shipping prices, not to mention some of our favorite beers can add up as well. Don't let this discourage you, though! Just keep this in mind and remember: trades yield deliciously valuable returns!			</li>			<li>It is illegal to ship alcohol via the United States Postal System (USPS), and, since it is a government agency, we discourage any BottleTrade members from choosing them as a shipping source. To paraphrase a famous shoe ad - Just don't do it! If you use them and the bottle breaks in transit, it is considered a federal offense and you can't say we didn't tell you so. So there.			</li>			<li>It is highly recommended that one ships through private shipping companies (i.e. FedEx, UPS, etc.).			</li>		</ul></div></div></div><div class="grid-content"><div class="card text-center"><img src="assets/img/educate/tips_tricks/image_2.jpg"/><div class="card-divider"><h4>Establishing Trades</h4></div><div class="card-section text-left">	<p>It is not as easy as it may seem to find someone online and trust that they will do exactly what they say they are 	going to do. We've all felt the Craiglist Burn before, and it stings! BottleTrade's system is designed to make 	that type of security a lot easier to come by, so that trades can be established and carried out with as little 	ain or insecurity as possible. We are not into S & M, really. Well, not when it comes to trading beer. 	Ok, time to get back to the point.		<br>	Our BottleTrade network is a social media platform that allows traders to communicate with each other and view what bottles are being offered.	It is in the hands of the traders to subjectively determine what a fair trade is, what shipping service will be 	utilized, and what dates the packages will be shipped out. (Terms and Conditions reminder: We are not responsible 	for the shipment of any bottle. We are simply a means of communication for craft beer enthusiasts like ourselves.) 	For more information on how to use our network, click here.		<br>		Some traders prefer having a trade value established in which the dollar amount spent on the bottles up for trade	 has to be matched at the very least. Others simply list what they have available for trade and stay on the lookout	  for offers of all kinds. It really becomes reliant on the two parties involved to figure out the terms of their 	  trade and agree before pressing the final trade button. Also, it is not uncommon, and quite frankly, 	  always so fucking awesome, for traders to throw in extra "goodies" or bottles into a trade just as a sign 	  of good faith. After all, if you find a good trade partner, you found a friend.	  <br />	Once the trade is established, shipping dates are decided upon and tracking numbers should be exchanged. 	Don't take it the wrong way if someone asks for a shipment and tracking number, as seasoned traders will 	often cover their bases by having someone they are new to trading with provide that information. You may 	find you want the same thing from others - It's just fine. The trade process requires patience, courtesy, 	trust, and respect to function smoothly. If negative reviews come pouring in, that will indicate that one or 	more of those requirements is not being heeded, and it will not end well for that person. No one likes to 	trade with impatient, inconsiderate, unreliable, and disrespectful people. No one. Never. Not ever.	<br />	Hopefully this gives some helpful insight and if you have any questions at all, feel free to shoot them our 	way here.	</p></div></div></div><div class="grid-content"><div class="card text-center"><img src="assets/img/educate/tips_tricks/image_3.jpg"/><div class="card-divider"><h4>Packaging Bottles Safely</h4></div><div class="card-section text-left">	<p>Packing bottles safely and prepping them for a transcontinental transit is a very important step in this process. Breakages are no fun for anyone. You can use all the bubble wrap you want to protect the package, but that can add up and get costly real quick! So, here are some tips to reassure yourself and your trading partner that the bottles will have a comfortable journey:	<ul>	<li>We recommend using a fantastic site called <a href="http://www.spiritedshipper.com/">http://www.spiritedshipper.com/</a> for shipper 	containers. Spirited Shipper provides patented shipper boxes made specifically for shipping 	bottles and is one of the safest ways to ship bottles. If it happens to be a very important bottle, 	it wouldn't hurt to throw some bubble wrap into these boxes for added protection. And no, we 	don't have any connection or compromise with this company. We just use them and happen 	to think, from our own personal shipping experiences, that their products are the bee's knees 	when it comes to getting bottles from As to Bs.	</li>	<li>If you do prefer an alternative method to Spirited Shipper, we recommend using what we like to 		call the floating box technique. This is how it works:		<ul>			<li>Wrap bottles in bubble wrap and pack them into a box.</li>			<li>Pack the box into a larger box and surround the smaller box (the one with the bottles in it) with package cushioning, which creates a sort of blanket layer around the smaller box and keeps your bottles safe and snug.			</li>			<li>Generally, you want to keep the bottles as far away from the edges of the box as possible since our friendly delivery servicemen tend to throw boxes around from time to time. Who can blame them? They live and breathe deadlines - too bad we can't offer them a beer to insure the safety of our packages!			</li>			<li>When dropping off your package, it is always better to have it prelabeled and packaged. It is not recommended, at all, to be taping up your policy-breaking package in front of an employee.			</li>			<li>If you're making your shipping payment and the employee happens to ask what is being shipped, acceptable responses include: fragile glassware, yeast samples, olive oil, etc. . Non-acceptable responses include: beer.			</li>		</ul>	</li>	</ul>These suggestions are by no means the tried and true way to ship your bottles. We have spoken with many traders as well as conducted our own trades practicing these techniques and have never had any issues. If you have your own techniques and they have worked, by all means, keep on trading!<br /><br />As always, feel free to <a class="underline" href="<?php echo UrlUtils::generateUrl(UrlUtils::ContactUsUri);  ?>">Contact Us</a> if you have any questions!<br /><br />		Cheers,<br />		BottleTrade	</p></div></div></div></div>
